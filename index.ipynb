In fact, even if training time were not a concern, normalization to a consistent scale across features (typically 0 to 1) should be used to ensure that the process converges to a stable solution. Similar to some of our previous work in training models, one general process for standardizing our data is:  \n",

    "Not only will normalizing your inputs speed up training, it can also mitigate other risks inherent in training neural networks. For example, in a neural network, having input of various ranges can lead to difficult numerical problems when the algorithm goes to compute gradients during forward and back propogation. This can lead to untenable solutions and will prevent the algorithm from converging to a solution. In short, make sure you normalize your data! Here's a little more mathematical background:"
